Day 08: Space Image Format

Part 1: To make sure the image wasn't corrupted during transmission, the Elves would like you to find the layer that contains the fewest 0 digits. 
        On that layer, what is the number of 1 digits multiplied by the number of 2 digits?
Answer: 2193

Part 2: What message is produced after decoding your image?
Answer: YEHEF

(Note: Part 2 is a rendered image. The printed text corresponds to visible letters.)
