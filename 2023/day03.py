#for loops also have an else clause which most of us are unfamiliar with. The else clause executes after the loop completes normally. 
#This means that the loop did not encounter a break statement. They are really useful once you understand where to use them. I, myself, came to know about them a lot later.

#The common construct is to run a loop and search for an item. If the item is found, we break out of the loop using the break statement. 
#There are two scenarios in which the loop may end. The first one is when the item is found and break is encountered. 
#The second scenario is that the loop ends without encountering a break statement. Now we may want to know which one of these is the reason for a loopâ€™s completion. 
#One method is to set a flag and then check it once the loop ends. Another is to use the else clause.
